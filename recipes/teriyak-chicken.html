    <h3>Steps for making Teriyaki Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok.
        Add chicken and let cook (giving space between pieces) until slightly browned on bottom then flip chicken pieces over and cook through.
        While the chicken is cooking whisk together the teriyaki sauce mixture.
        Pour sauce into the skillet once the chicken is just nearly finished cooking through and let the sauce cook and simmer until thickened.
        Easy as that! Serve it warm over brown or white rice with steamed veggies.
